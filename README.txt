# word-count-prideandprejudice
Word and Letter Frequency Counter for Pride and Prejudice.

The main file to execute is WordAndLetterFrequency.py. The main dependency is Functions.py, 
as it contains important functions to list and update words in the dictionary which displays
the frequency. The text file for Pride and Prejudice is also attached. The project was written by
me, Samarth Menon, alone. Tested to run on Python 2.7.13, Windows 10 x64. Under MIT license.
